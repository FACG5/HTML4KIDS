# HTML4KIDS

## What ?

Our website that give you ability to enter any HTML tag in the input field which will give you back sensible suggestion related to the selected HTML tags.

## How ?

We started out with a simple plan to create a front end web page which makes a call to a back end server with a few assets which it serves as well as sending a query (the user's input) to this back end which it searches through and returns a matching string.

   *  Create repository and organise files.
   *  create HTML & CSS & DOM files.
   *  Creating our server and starting to create our functions.
   *  Modularisation.
   

* Day 2:
  * Completing our functions.
  * Testing.
  * Deploying on Heroku.

### File Structure

   *  HTML
